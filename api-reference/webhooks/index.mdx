## Overview

Webhooks allow you to receive real-time notifications when events occur in Oliver. When an event is triggered, Oliver sends an HTTP POST request to your configured endpoint with a JSON payload containing the relevant data.

## Webhook Payload Structure

All webhook payloads are sent as JSON objects with the following structure:

<ResponseField name="practice_name" type="string" required>
  The name of the veterinary practice associated with the event.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="client_id" type="string" required>
  The unique identifier for the client (pet owner) associated with the event.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="patient_id" type="string" required>
  The unique identifier for the patient (pet) associated with the event.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="service_code_ids" type="array" required>
  An array of service code identifiers associated with the event.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="due_at" type="string" required>
  The date and time when the associated action is due, in ISO 8601 format.
</ResponseField>

## Example Payload

```json
{
  "practice_name": "Happy Paws Veterinary Clinic",
  "client_id": "cli_abc123",
  "patient_id": "pat_xyz789",
  "service_code_ids": ["svc_001", "svc_002"],
  "due_at": "2025-01-15T14:30:00Z"
}
```

## Handling Webhooks

When receiving a webhook, your endpoint should:

1. Respond with a `200 OK` status code to acknowledge receipt
2. Process the payload asynchronously if needed to avoid timeouts
3. Validate the payload structure before processing

<Note>
  If your endpoint fails to respond with a success status code, Oliver may retry the webhook delivery.
