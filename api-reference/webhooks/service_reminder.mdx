title: 'Service Reminder Webhook'
description: 'Receive notifications when service reminders are due'
---

## Overview

The Service Reminder webhook notifies your system when a patient has services coming due. When a service reminder is triggered, Oliver sends an HTTP POST request to your configured endpoint with a JSON payload containing the reminder details.

## Payload Structure

The webhook payload is sent as a JSON object with the following structure:

<ResponseField name="practice_name" type="string" required>
  The name of the veterinary practice associated with the reminder.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="client_id" type="string" required>
  The unique identifier for the client (pet owner) who should be notified.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="patient_id" type="string" required>
  The unique identifier for the patient (pet) who has services due.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="service_code_ids" type="array" required>
  An array of service code identifiers for the services that are due.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="due_at" type="string" required>
  The date and time when the services are due, in ISO 8601 format.
</ResponseField>

## Example Payload

```json
{
  "practice_name": "Happy Paws Veterinary Clinic",
  "client_id": "cli_abc123",
  "patient_id": "pat_xyz789",
  "service_code_ids": ["svc_001", "svc_002"],
  "due_at": "2025-01-15T14:30:00Z"
}
```

## Handling the Webhook

When receiving a service reminder webhook, your endpoint should:

1. Respond with a `200 OK` status code to acknowledge receipt
2. Process the reminder asynchronously if needed to avoid timeouts
3. Use the `client_id` and `patient_id` to look up contact information
4. Send appropriate reminder notifications to the client

<Note>
  If your endpoint fails to respond with a success status code, Oliver may retry the webhook delivery.
